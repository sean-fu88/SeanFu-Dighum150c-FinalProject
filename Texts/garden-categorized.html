They could not have had a more perfect <span class="cosmic_time">day</span> for a garden-party if they had ordered it . Windless, warm, the <span class="gas">sky</span> without a <span class="group">cloud</span>. Only the <span class="substance">blue</span> was veiled with a <span class="natural_phenomenon">haze</span> of <span class="appearance">light</span> <span class="substance">gold</span>, as it is sometimes in early <span class="time_period">summer</span>. The <span class="physical_entity">gardener</span> had been up since <span class="time_period">dawn</span>, mowing the <span class="region">lawns</span> and sweeping them, until the <span class="physical_entity">grass</span> and the <span class="time_period">dark</span> flat <span class="natural_object">rosettes</span> where the <span class="living_thing">daisy</span> <span class="living_thing">plants</span> had been seemed to shine . As for the <span class="visual_property">roses</span>, you could not help feeling they understood that <span class="visual_property">roses</span> are the only <span class="living_thing">flowers</span> that impress <span class="kin">people</span> at garden-parties; the only <span class="living_thing">flowers</span> that everybody is certain of knowing . <span class="number">Hundreds</span>, yes, literally <span class="number">hundreds</span>, had come out in a single <span class="information">night</span>; the green <span class="living_thing">bushes</span> bowed down as though they had been visited by <span class="living_thing">archangels</span>. Breakfast was not yet over before the <span class="physical_entity">men</span> came to put up the <span class="artifact">marquee</span>.``Where do you want the <span class="artifact">marquee</span> put, <span class="content">mother</span>?"`` My <span class="physical_entity">dear</span> <span class="physical_entity">child</span>, it's no <span class="utility">use</span> asking me . I'm determined to leave everything to you <span class="physical_entity">children</span> this <span class="time_period">year</span>. Forget I am your <span class="content">mother</span>. Treat me as an honoured <span class="artifact">guest</span>."But Meg could not possibly go and supervise the <span class="physical_entity">men</span>. She had washed her <span class="body_part">hair</span> before <span class="food">breakfast</span>, and she <span class="time_period">sat</span> drinking her <span class="natural_object">coffee</span> in a green <span class="artifact">turban</span>, with a <span class="time_period">dark</span> <span class="condition">wet</span> <span class="natural_object">curl</span> stamped on each <span class="disrespect">cheek</span>. Jose, the <span class="act">butterfly</span>, always came down in a <span class="artifact">silk</span> <span class="artifact">petticoat</span> and a <span class="artifact">kimono</span> <span class="substance">jacket</span>.``You'll have to go, Laura; you're the artistic <span class="content">one</span>."Away Laura flew, still holding her <span class="time_period">piece</span> of bread-and-butter . It's so delicious to have an <span class="artifact">excuse</span> for eating out of <span class="artifact">doors</span>, and besides, she loved having to arrange <span class="physical_entity">things</span>; she always felt she could do it so much better than anybody else . Four <span class="physical_entity">men</span> in their shirt-sleeves stood grouped together on the <span class="region">garden</span> <span class="act">path</span>. They carried <span class="artifact">staves</span> covered with <span class="writing">rolls</span> of <span class="artifact">canvas</span>, and they had big tool-bags slung on their <span class="artifact">backs</span>. They looked impressive . Laura wished now that she had not got the bread-and-butter, but there was nowhere to put it, and she couldn't possibly throw it away . She blushed and tried to <span class="condition">look</span> severe and even a little <span class="small_indefinite_quantity">bit</span> short-sighted as she came up to them .``Good <span class="acknowledgment">morning</span>,"she said, copying her <span class="content">mother</span>'s <span class="grammatical_relation">voice</span>. But that sounded so fearfully affected that she was ashamed, and stammered like a little <span class="physical_entity">girl</span>,``Oh---er---have you come---is it about the <span class="artifact">marquee</span>?"`` That's <span class="act">right</span>, <span class="language_unit">miss</span>,"said the tallest of the <span class="physical_entity">men</span>, a lanky, freckled <span class="number">fellow</span>, and he shifted his tool-bag, knocked <span class="artifact">back</span> his <span class="artifact">straw</span> <span class="act">hat</span> and smiled down at her .``That's about it ."His <span class="gesture">smile</span> was so easy, so friendly that Laura recovered . What nice <span class="artifact">eyes</span> he had, small, but such a <span class="time_period">dark</span> <span class="substance">blue</span>! And now she looked at the others, they were smiling too .``Cheer up, we won't <span class="condition">bite</span>,"their <span class="gesture">smile</span> seemed to say . How very nice <span class="physical_entity">workmen</span> were! And what a beautiful <span class="acknowledgment">morning</span>! She mustn't mention the <span class="acknowledgment">morning</span>; she must be business-like . The <span class="artifact">marquee</span>.``Well, what about the lily-lawn? Would that do?"And she pointed to the lily-lawn with the <span class="physical_entity">hand</span> that didn't <span class="artifact">hold</span> the bread-and-butter . They turned, they stared in the <span class="act">direction</span>. A little fat <span class="solid">chap</span> <span class="act">thrust</span> out his under-lip, and the tall <span class="number">fellow</span> frowned .``I don't fancy it ,"said he .``Not conspicuous enough . You see, with a <span class="physical_entity">thing</span> like a <span class="artifact">marquee</span>,"and he turned to Laura in his easy <span class="assets">way</span>,``you want to put it somewhere where it'll give you a bang <span class="act">slap</span> in the <span class="artifact">eye</span>, if you follow me ."Laura's <span class="inheritance">upbringing</span> made her <span class="condition">wonder</span> for a <span class="information">moment</span> whether it was quite respectful of a <span class="physical_entity">workman</span> to talk to her of <span class="happening">bangs</span> <span class="act">slap</span> in the <span class="artifact">eye</span>. But she did quite follow him .``A <span class="solid">corner</span> of the tennis-court ,"she suggested .``But the <span class="artifact">band</span>'s going to be in <span class="content">one</span> <span class="solid">corner</span>."`` H'm, going to have a <span class="artifact">band</span>, are you?"said another of the <span class="physical_entity">workmen</span>. He was <span class="artifact">pale</span>. He had a haggard <span class="condition">look</span> as his <span class="time_period">dark</span> <span class="artifact">eyes</span> scanned the tennis-court . What was he thinking?``Only a very small <span class="artifact">band</span>,"said Laura gently . Perhaps he wouldn't mind so much if the <span class="artifact">band</span> was quite small . But the tall <span class="number">fellow</span> interrupted .``<span class="condition">Look</span> here, <span class="language_unit">miss</span>, that's the <span class="point">place</span>. Against those <span class="figure">trees</span>. Over there . That'll do fine ."Against the karakas . Then the karaka-trees would be hidden . And they were so lovely, with their broad, gleaming <span class="section">leaves</span>, and their <span class="agglomeration">clusters</span> of yellow <span class="artifact">fruit</span>. They were like <span class="figure">trees</span> you imagined growing on a <span class="community">desert</span> <span class="point">island</span>, proud, solitary, lifting their <span class="section">leaves</span> and <span class="artifact">fruits</span> to the <span class="time_period">sun</span> in a <span class="content">kind</span> of silent <span class="visual_property">splendour</span>. Must they be hidden by a <span class="artifact">marquee</span>? They must . Already the <span class="physical_entity">men</span> had shouldered their <span class="artifact">staves</span> and were making for the <span class="point">place</span>. Only the tall <span class="number">fellow</span> was left . He bent down, pinched a <span class="artifact">sprig</span> of <span class="visual_property">lavender</span>, put his <span class="artifact">thumb</span> and <span class="body_part">forefinger</span> to his <span class="artifact">nose</span> and snuffed up the <span class="condition">smell</span>. When Laura saw that <span class="act">gesture</span> she forgot all about the karakas in her <span class="condition">wonder</span> at him caring for <span class="physical_entity">things</span> like that---caring for the <span class="condition">smell</span> of <span class="visual_property">lavender</span>. How many <span class="physical_entity">men</span> that she knew would have done such a <span class="physical_entity">thing</span>? Oh, how extraordinarily nice <span class="physical_entity">workmen</span> were, she thought . Why couldn't she have <span class="physical_entity">workmen</span> for her <span class="physical_entity">friends</span> rather than the silly boys she danced with and who came to Sunday <span class="information">night</span> <span class="gathering">supper</span>? She would get on much better with <span class="physical_entity">men</span> like these . It's all the <span class="act">fault</span>, she decided, as the tall <span class="number">fellow</span> drew something on the <span class="artifact">back</span> of an <span class="artifact">envelope</span>, something that was to be looped up or left to hang, of these absurd <span class="act">class</span> <span class="difference">distinctions</span>. Well, for her <span class="music">part</span>, she didn't feel them . Not a <span class="small_indefinite_quantity">bit</span>, not an atom\...And now there came the chock-chock of wooden <span class="artifact">hammers</span>. Some <span class="content">one</span> whistled, some <span class="content">one</span> <span class="living_thing">sang</span> out ,"Are you <span class="act">right</span> there, matey?"`` Matey!"The <span class="nature">friendliness</span> of it, the---the---Just to prove how happy she was, just to show the tall <span class="number">fellow</span> how at <span class="artifact">home</span> she felt, and how she despised stupid <span class="unoriginality">conventions</span>, Laura took a big <span class="condition">bite</span> of her bread-and-butter as she stared at the little <span class="act">drawing</span>. She felt just like a work-girl .``Laura, Laura, where are you? <span class="artifact">Telephone</span>, Laura!"a <span class="grammatical_relation">voice</span> cried from the <span class="artifact">house</span>.``Coming!"Away she skimmed, over the <span class="region">lawn</span>, up the <span class="act">path</span>, up the <span class="writing">steps</span>, across the <span class="artifact">veranda</span>, and into the <span class="artifact">porch</span>. In the <span class="artifact">hall</span> her <span class="physical_entity">father</span> and Laurie were brushing their <span class="act">hats</span> ready to go to the <span class="act">office</span>.``I say, Laura ,"said Laurie very fast,``you might just give a squiz at my <span class="artifact">coat</span> before this <span class="acknowledgment">afternoon</span>. See if it wants pressing ."`` I will ,"said she . Suddenly she couldn't stop herself . She ran at Laurie and gave him a small, quick <span class="act">squeeze</span>.``Oh, I do love <span class="physical_entity">parties</span>, don't you?"gasped Laura .``Ra-ther ,"said Laurie's warm, boyish <span class="grammatical_relation">voice</span>, and he squeezed his <span class="physical_entity">sister</span> too, and gave her a gentle <span class="artifact">push</span>.``Dash off to the <span class="artifact">telephone</span>, old <span class="physical_entity">girl</span>."The <span class="artifact">telephone</span>.``Yes, yes; oh yes . Kitty? Good <span class="acknowledgment">morning</span>, <span class="physical_entity">dear</span>. Come to <span class="food">lunch</span>? Do, <span class="physical_entity">dear</span>. Delighted of <span class="line">course</span>. It will only be a very scratch <span class="food">meal</span>---just the <span class="food">sandwich</span> <span class="natural_object">crusts</span> and broken meringue-shells and what's left over . Yes, isn't it a perfect <span class="acknowledgment">morning</span>? Your white? Oh, I certainly should . One <span class="information">moment</span>---hold the <span class="solid">line</span>. <span class="content">Mother</span>'s calling ."And Laura <span class="time_period">sat</span> <span class="artifact">back</span>.``What, <span class="content">mother</span>? Can't hear ."Mrs. Sheridan's <span class="grammatical_relation">voice</span> floated down the <span class="artifact">stairs</span>.``Tell her to wear that <span class="food">sweet</span> <span class="act">hat</span> she had on last Sunday ."`` <span class="content">Mother</span> says you're to wear that <span class="food">sweet</span> <span class="act">hat</span> you had on last Sunday . Good . One o'clock . Bye-bye ."Laura put <span class="artifact">back</span> the <span class="physical_entity">receiver</span>, flung her <span class="artifact">arms</span> over her <span class="artifact">head</span>, took a deep <span class="natural_phenomenon">breath</span>, stretched and let them fall .``Huh ,"she sighed, and the <span class="information">moment</span> after the sigh she <span class="time_period">sat</span> up quickly . She was still, listening . All the <span class="artifact">doors</span> in the <span class="artifact">house</span> seemed to be open . The <span class="artifact">house</span> was alive with soft, quick <span class="writing">steps</span> and running <span class="grammatical_relation">voices</span>. The green <span class="artifact">baize</span> <span class="artifact">door</span> that led to the <span class="artifact">kitchen</span> <span class="content">regions</span> swung open and shut with a muffled <span class="happening">thud</span>. And now there came a long, chuckling absurd <span class="channel">sound</span>. It was the heavy <span class="artifact">piano</span> being moved on its stiff castors . But the <span class="music">air</span>! If you stopped to notice, was the <span class="music">air</span> always like this? Little faint <span class="artifact">winds</span> were playing <span class="artifact">chase</span>, in at the <span class="artifact">tops</span> of the <span class="writing">windows</span>, out at the <span class="artifact">doors</span>. And there were two tiny <span class="happening">spots</span> of <span class="time_period">sun</span>, <span class="content">one</span> on the <span class="artifact">inkpot</span>, <span class="content">one</span> on a <span class="symbol">silver</span> <span class="artifact">photograph</span> <span class="body_part">frame</span>, playing too . <span class="physical_entity">Darling</span> little <span class="happening">spots</span>. Especially the <span class="content">one</span> on the <span class="artifact">inkpot</span> <span class="artifact">lid</span>. It was quite warm . A warm little <span class="symbol">silver</span> <span class="structure">star</span>. She could have kissed it . The front <span class="artifact">door</span> <span class="artifact">bell</span> pealed, and there sounded the <span class="happening">rustle</span> of Sadie's <span class="artifact">print</span> <span class="artifact">skirt</span> on the <span class="artifact">stairs</span>. A <span class="physical_entity">man</span>'s <span class="grammatical_relation">voice</span> murmured; Sadie answered, careless,``I'm sure I don't know . Wait . I'll ask Mrs Sheridan ."`` What is it, Sadie?"Laura came into the <span class="artifact">hall</span>.``It's the <span class="artifact">florist</span>, Miss Laura ."It was, indeed . There, just inside the <span class="artifact">door</span>, stood a wide, shallow <span class="artifact">tray</span> full of <span class="artifact">pots</span> of <span class="physical_entity">pink</span> <span class="living_thing">lilies</span>. No other <span class="content">kind</span>. <span class="relative_quantity">Nothing</span> but <span class="living_thing">lilies</span>---canna <span class="living_thing">lilies</span>, big <span class="physical_entity">pink</span> <span class="living_thing">flowers</span>, wide open, radiant, almost frighteningly alive on bright <span class="visual_property">crimson</span> <span class="act">stems</span>.``O-oh, Sadie!"said Laura, and the <span class="channel">sound</span> was like a little <span class="utterance">moan</span>. She crouched down as if to warm herself at that <span class="happening">blaze</span> of <span class="living_thing">lilies</span>; she felt they were in her <span class="artifact">fingers</span>, on her <span class="line">lips</span>, growing in her <span class="body_part">breast</span>.``It's some <span class="act">mistake</span>,"she said faintly .``<span class="physical_entity">Nobody</span> ever ordered so many . Sadie, go and find <span class="content">mother</span>."But at that <span class="information">moment</span> Mrs. Sheridan joined them .``It's quite <span class="act">right</span>,"she said calmly .``Yes, I ordered them . Aren't they lovely?"She pressed Laura's <span class="artifact">arm</span>.``I was passing the <span class="act">shop</span> <span class="past">yesterday</span>, and I saw them in the <span class="artifact">window</span>. And I suddenly thought for once in my <span class="time_period">life</span> I shall have enough <span class="living_thing">canna</span> <span class="living_thing">lilies</span>. The garden-party will be a good <span class="artifact">excuse</span>."`` But I thought you said you didn't mean to interfere ,"said Laura . Sadie had gone . The <span class="artifact">florist</span>'s <span class="physical_entity">man</span> was still outside at his <span class="artifact">van</span>. She put her <span class="artifact">arm</span> <span class="content">round</span> her <span class="content">mother</span>'s <span class="artifact">neck</span> and gently, very gently, she <span class="small_indefinite_quantity">bit</span> her <span class="content">mother</span>'s <span class="natural_object">ear</span>.``My <span class="physical_entity">darling</span> <span class="physical_entity">child</span>, you wouldn't like a logical <span class="content">mother</span>, would you? Don't do that . Here's the <span class="physical_entity">man</span>."He carried more <span class="living_thing">lilies</span> still, another whole <span class="artifact">tray</span>.``Bank them up, just inside the <span class="artifact">door</span>, on both <span class="food">sides</span> of the <span class="artifact">porch</span>, please ,"said Mrs. Sheridan .``Don't you agree, Laura?"`` Oh, I do, <span class="content">mother</span>."In the drawing-room Meg, Jose and good little <span class="kin">Hans</span> had at last succeeded in moving the <span class="artifact">piano</span>.``Now, if we put this <span class="artifact">chesterfield</span> against the <span class="artifact">wall</span> and move everything out of the <span class="gathering">room</span> except the <span class="artifact">chairs</span>, don't you think?"`` Quite ."`` <span class="kin">Hans</span>, move these <span class="gathering">tables</span> into the smoking-room, and bring a <span class="artifact">sweeper</span> to take these <span class="indicator">marks</span> off the <span class="artifact">carpet</span> and---one <span class="information">moment</span>, <span class="kin">Hans</span>---"Jose loved giving <span class="condition">orders</span> to the <span class="physical_entity">servants</span>, and they loved obeying her .

Let's try over 'This <span class="time_period">life</span> is Weary .'"<span class="physical_entity">Pom</span>! Ta-ta-ta Tee-ta! The <span class="artifact">piano</span> <span class="happening">burst</span> out so passionately that Jose's <span class="region">face</span> changed . She clasped her <span class="physical_entity">hands</span>. She looked mournfully and enigmatically at her <span class="content">mother</span> and Laura as they came in .``This Life is Wee-ary, A Tear—a Sigh . A Love that Chan-ges, This Life is Wee-ary, A Tear—a Sigh . A Love that Chan-ges, And then...<span class="acknowledgment">Good-bye</span>!"But at the <span class="unit_of_measurement">word</span>``<span class="acknowledgment">Good-bye</span>,"and although the <span class="artifact">piano</span> sounded more desperate than ever, her <span class="region">face</span> broke into a brilliant, dreadfully unsympathetic <span class="gesture">smile</span>.``Aren't I in good <span class="grammatical_relation">voice</span>, <span class="natural_object">mummy</span>?"she beamed .``This Life is Wee-ary, Hope comes to Die . A Dream—a Wa-kening ."But now Sadie interrupted them .``What is it, Sadie?"`` If you please, m'm, cook says have you got the <span class="artifact">flags</span> for the <span class="food">sandwiches</span>?"`` The <span class="artifact">flags</span> for the <span class="food">sandwiches</span>, Sadie?"echoed Mrs. Sheridan dreamily . And the <span class="physical_entity">children</span> knew by her <span class="region">face</span> that she hadn't got them .``Let me see ."And she said to Sadie firmly,``Tell cook I'll let her have them in <span class="substance">ten</span> <span class="point">minutes</span>."Sadie went .``Now, Laura ,"said her <span class="content">mother</span> quickly,``come with me into the smoking-room . I've got the <span class="disrespect">names</span> somewhere on the <span class="artifact">back</span> of an <span class="artifact">envelope</span>. You'll have to write them out for me . Meg, go upstairs this <span class="point">minute</span> and take that <span class="condition">wet</span> <span class="physical_entity">thing</span> off your <span class="artifact">head</span>. Jose, <span class="act">run</span> and finish <span class="food">dressing</span> this <span class="point">instant</span>. Do you hear me, <span class="physical_entity">children</span>, or shall I have to tell your <span class="physical_entity">father</span> when he comes <span class="artifact">home</span> to-night? And---and, Jose, pacify cook if you do go into the <span class="artifact">kitchen</span>, will you? I'm terrified of her this <span class="acknowledgment">morning</span>."The <span class="artifact">envelope</span> was found at last behind the <span class="artifact">dining-room</span> <span class="artifact">clock</span>, though how it had got there Mrs. Sheridan could not imagine .``One of you <span class="physical_entity">children</span> must have stolen it out of my <span class="artifact">bag</span>, because I remember vividly---cream cheese and lemon-curd . Have you done that?"`` Yes ."`` <span class="food">Egg</span> and---"Mrs. Sheridan held the <span class="artifact">envelope</span> away from her .``It looks like <span class="condition">mice</span>. It can't be <span class="condition">mice</span>, can it?"`` Olive, pet ,"said Laura, looking over her <span class="region">shoulder</span>.``Yes, of <span class="line">course</span>, olive . What a horrible <span class="act">combination</span> it sounds . <span class="food">Egg</span> and olive ."They were finished at last, and Laura took them off to the <span class="artifact">kitchen</span>. She found Jose there pacifying the cook, who did not <span class="condition">look</span> at all terrifying .``I have never seen such exquisite <span class="food">sandwiches</span>,"said Jose's rapturous <span class="grammatical_relation">voice</span>.``How many <span class="content">kinds</span> did you say there were, cook? <span class="number">Fifteen</span>?"`` <span class="number">Fifteen</span>, Miss Jose ."`` Well, cook, I congratulate you ."Cook swept up <span class="natural_object">crusts</span> with the long <span class="food">sandwich</span> <span class="artifact">knife</span>, and smiled broadly .``Godber's has come ,"announced Sadie, issuing out of the <span class="artifact">pantry</span>. She had seen the <span class="physical_entity">man</span> pass the <span class="artifact">window</span>. That meant the <span class="artifact">cream</span> <span class="bodily_process">puffs</span> had come . Godber's were famous for their <span class="artifact">cream</span> <span class="bodily_process">puffs</span>. <span class="physical_entity">Nobody</span> ever thought of making them at <span class="artifact">home</span>.``Bring them in and put them on the <span class="gathering">table</span>, my <span class="physical_entity">girl</span>,"ordered cook . Sadie brought them in and went <span class="artifact">back</span> to the <span class="artifact">door</span>. Of <span class="line">course</span> Laura and Jose were far too grown-up to really care about such <span class="physical_entity">things</span>. All the same, they couldn't help agreeing that the <span class="bodily_process">puffs</span> looked very attractive . Very . Cook began arranging them, shaking off the extra <span class="artifact">icing</span> <span class="food">sugar</span>.``Don't they carry <span class="content">one</span> <span class="artifact">back</span> to all <span class="content">one</span>'s <span class="physical_entity">parties</span>?"said Laura .``I suppose they do ,"said practical Jose, who never liked to be carried <span class="artifact">back</span>.``They <span class="condition">look</span> beautifully <span class="appearance">light</span> and feathery, I must say ."`` Have <span class="content">one</span> each, my <span class="physical_entity">dears</span>,"said cook in her comfortable <span class="grammatical_relation">voice</span>.``Yer <span class="symbol">ma</span> won't know ."Oh, impossible .

The very <span class="music">idea</span> made <span class="content">one</span> <span class="act">shudder</span>. All the same, two <span class="point">minutes</span> later Jose and Laura were licking their <span class="artifact">fingers</span> with that absorbed inward <span class="condition">look</span> that only comes from whipped <span class="artifact">cream</span>.``Let's go into the <span class="region">garden</span>, out by the <span class="artifact">back</span> <span class="assets">way</span>,"suggested Laura .``I want to see how the <span class="physical_entity">men</span> are getting on with the <span class="artifact">marquee</span>. They're such awfully nice <span class="physical_entity">men</span>."But the <span class="artifact">back</span> <span class="artifact">door</span> was blocked by cook, Sadie, Godber's <span class="physical_entity">man</span> and <span class="kin">Hans</span>. Something had happened .``Tuk-tuk-tuk ,"clucked cook like an agitated <span class="living_thing">hen</span>. Sadie had her <span class="physical_entity">hand</span> clapped to her <span class="disrespect">cheek</span> as though she had <span class="information">toothache</span>. <span class="kin">Hans</span>'s <span class="region">face</span> was screwed up in the <span class="act">effort</span> to understand . Only Godber's <span class="physical_entity">man</span> seemed to be enjoying himself; it was his <span class="writing">story</span>.``What's the <span class="cognitive_factor">matter</span>? What's happened?"`` There's been a horrible <span class="happening">accident</span>,"said Cook .``A <span class="physical_entity">man</span> killed ."`` A <span class="physical_entity">man</span> killed! Where? How? When?"But Godber's <span class="physical_entity">man</span> wasn't going to have his <span class="writing">story</span> snatched from under his very <span class="artifact">nose</span>.``Know those little <span class="artifact">cottages</span> just below here, <span class="language_unit">miss</span>?"Know them? Of <span class="line">course</span>, she knew them .``Well, there's a young <span class="solid">chap</span> <span class="assets">living</span> there, <span class="disrespect">name</span> of Scott, a <span class="physical_entity">carter</span>. His <span class="artifact">horse</span> shied at a traction-engine, <span class="solid">corner</span> of Hawke Street this <span class="acknowledgment">morning</span>, and he was thrown out on the <span class="artifact">back</span> of his <span class="artifact">head</span>. Killed ."`` Dead!"Laura stared at Godber's <span class="physical_entity">man</span>.``Dead when they picked him up ,"said Godber's <span class="physical_entity">man</span> with relish .``They were taking the <span class="artifact">body</span> <span class="artifact">home</span> as I come up here ."And he said to the cook ,"He's left a <span class="physical_entity">wife</span> and five little <span class="content">ones</span>."`` Jose, come here ."Laura caught <span class="artifact">hold</span> of her <span class="physical_entity">sister</span>'s <span class="artifact">sleeve</span> and dragged her through the <span class="artifact">kitchen</span> to the other <span class="food">side</span> of the green <span class="artifact">baize</span> <span class="artifact">door</span>. There she paused and leaned against it .``Jose!"she said, horrified,``however are we going to stop everything?"`` Stop everything, Laura!"cried Jose in <span class="feeling">astonishment</span>.``What do you mean?"`` Stop the garden-party, of <span class="line">course</span>."Why did Jose <span class="act">pretend</span>? But Jose was still more amazed .``Stop the garden-party? My <span class="physical_entity">dear</span> Laura, don't be so absurd . Of <span class="line">course</span> we can't do anything of the <span class="content">kind</span>. <span class="physical_entity">Nobody</span> expects us to . Don't be so extravagant ."`` But we can't possibly have a garden-party with a <span class="physical_entity">man</span> dead just outside the front <span class="assets">gate</span>."That really was extravagant, for the little <span class="artifact">cottages</span> were in a <span class="artifact">lane</span> to themselves at the very <span class="land">bottom</span> of a steep <span class="gradient">rise</span> that led up to the <span class="artifact">house</span>. A broad <span class="act">road</span> ran between . True, they were far too near . They were the greatest possible <span class="appearance">eyesore</span>, and they had no <span class="act">right</span> to be in that <span class="region">neighbourhood</span> at all . They were little mean <span class="artifact">dwellings</span> painted a <span class="substance">chocolate</span> brown . In the <span class="region">garden</span> <span class="time_period">patches</span> there was <span class="relative_quantity">nothing</span> but <span class="living_thing">cabbage</span> <span class="act">stalks</span>, sick <span class="living_thing">hens</span> and <span class="food">tomato</span> <span class="artifact">cans</span>. The very <span class="phase_change">smoke</span> coming out of their <span class="artifact">chimneys</span> was poverty-stricken . Little <span class="music">rags</span> and <span class="small_indefinite_quantity">shreds</span> of <span class="phase_change">smoke</span>, so unlike the great silvery <span class="artifact">plumes</span> that uncurled from the Sheridans' <span class="artifact">chimneys</span>. <span class="physical_entity">Washerwomen</span> lived in the <span class="artifact">lane</span> and <span class="act">sweeps</span> and a <span class="food">cobbler</span>, and a <span class="physical_entity">man</span> whose house-front was studded all over with <span class="point">minute</span> bird-cages . Children swarmed . When the Sheridans were little they were forbidden to set <span class="writing_style">foot</span> there because of the revolting <span class="language_unit">language</span> and of what they might catch . But since they were grown up, Laura and Laurie on their <span class="act">prowls</span> sometimes walked through . It was disgusting and sordid . They came out with a <span class="act">shudder</span>. But still <span class="content">one</span> must go everywhere; <span class="content">one</span> must see everything . So through they went .``And just think of what the <span class="artifact">band</span> would <span class="channel">sound</span> like to that poor <span class="class">woman</span>,"said Laura .``Oh, Laura!"Jose began to be seriously annoyed .``If you're going to stop a <span class="artifact">band</span> playing every <span class="happening">time</span> some <span class="content">one</span> has an <span class="happening">accident</span>, you'll lead a very strenuous <span class="time_period">life</span>. I'm every <span class="small_indefinite_quantity">bit</span> as sorry about it as you . I feel just as sympathetic ."Her <span class="artifact">eyes</span> hardened . She looked at her <span class="physical_entity">sister</span> just as she used to when they were little and fighting together .``You won't bring a drunken <span class="physical_entity">workman</span> <span class="artifact">back</span> to <span class="time_period">life</span> by being sentimental ,"she said softly .``<span class="physical_entity">Drunk</span>! Who said he was drunk?"Laura turned furiously on Jose . She said, just as they had used to say on those <span class="moment">occasions</span>,``I'm going straight up to tell <span class="content">mother</span>."`` Do, <span class="physical_entity">dear</span>,"cooed Jose .``<span class="content">Mother</span>, can I come into your <span class="gathering">room</span>?"Laura turned the big <span class="agent">glass</span> door-knob .``Of <span class="line">course</span>, <span class="physical_entity">child</span>. Why, what's the <span class="cognitive_factor">matter</span>? What's given you such a <span class="appearance">colour</span>?"And Mrs. Sheridan turned <span class="content">round</span> from her dressing-table . She was trying on a new <span class="act">hat</span>.``<span class="content">Mother</span>, a <span class="physical_entity">man</span>'s been killed ,"began Laura .``Not in the <span class="region">garden</span>?"interrupted her <span class="content">mother</span>.``No, no!"`` Oh, what a <span class="feeling">fright</span> you gave me!"Mrs. Sheridan sighed with <span class="pause">relief</span>, and took off the big <span class="act">hat</span> and held it on her <span class="body_part">knees</span>.``But listen, <span class="content">mother</span>,"said Laura . Breathless, half-choking, she told the dreadful <span class="writing">story</span>.``Of <span class="line">course</span>, we can't have our <span class="physical_entity">party</span>, can we?"she pleaded .``The <span class="artifact">band</span> and everybody arriving . They'd hear us, <span class="content">mother</span>; they're nearly <span class="object">neighbours</span>!"To Laura's <span class="feeling">astonishment</span> her <span class="content">mother</span> behaved just like Jose; it was harder to bear because she seemed amused . She refused to take Laura seriously .``But, my <span class="physical_entity">dear</span> <span class="physical_entity">child</span>, <span class="utility">use</span> your common <span class="process">sense</span>. It's only by <span class="happening">accident</span> we've heard of it . If some <span class="content">one</span> had died there normally---and I can't understand how they keep alive in those poky little <span class="imperfection">holes</span>---we should still be having our <span class="physical_entity">party</span>, shouldn't we?"Laura had to say``yes"to that, but she felt it was all wrong . She <span class="time_period">sat</span> down on her <span class="content">mother</span>'s <span class="artifact">sofa</span> and pinched the <span class="artifact">cushion</span> <span class="artifact">frill</span>.``<span class="content">Mother</span>, isn't it terribly heartless of us?"she asked .``<span class="physical_entity">Darling</span>!"Mrs. Sheridan got up and came over to her, carrying the <span class="act">hat</span>. Before Laura could stop her she had popped it on .``My <span class="physical_entity">child</span>!"said her <span class="content">mother</span>,``the <span class="act">hat</span> is yours . It's made for you . It's much too young for me . I have never seen you <span class="condition">look</span> such a <span class="statement">picture</span>. <span class="condition">Look</span> at yourself!"And she held up her hand-mirror .``But, <span class="content">mother</span>,"Laura began again . She couldn't <span class="condition">look</span> at herself; she turned aside . This <span class="happening">time</span> Mrs. Sheridan lost <span class="act">patience</span> just as Jose had done .``You are being very absurd, Laura ,"she said coldly .``<span class="kin">People</span> like that don't expect <span class="act">sacrifices</span> from us . And it's not very sympathetic to spoil everybody's <span class="feeling">enjoyment</span> as you're doing now ."`` I don't understand ,"said Laura, and she walked quickly out of the <span class="gathering">room</span> into her own <span class="artifact">bedroom</span>. There, quite by <span class="measure">chance</span>, the first <span class="physical_entity">thing</span> she saw was this charming <span class="physical_entity">girl</span> in the <span class="process">mirror</span>, in her black <span class="act">hat</span> trimmed with <span class="substance">gold</span> <span class="living_thing">daisies</span>, and a long black <span class="artifact">velvet</span> <span class="artifact">ribbon</span>. Never had she imagined she could <span class="condition">look</span> like that . Is <span class="content">mother</span> <span class="act">right</span>? she thought . And now she hoped her <span class="content">mother</span> was <span class="act">right</span>. <span class="symbol">Am</span> I being extravagant? Perhaps it was extravagant . Just for a <span class="information">moment</span> she had another <span class="indication">glimpse</span> of that poor <span class="class">woman</span> and those little <span class="physical_entity">children</span>, and the <span class="artifact">body</span> being carried into the <span class="artifact">house</span>. But it all seemed blurred, unreal, like a <span class="statement">picture</span> in the <span class="artifact">newspaper</span>. I'll remember it again after the <span class="physical_entity">party</span>'s over, she decided . And somehow that seemed quite the best plan\...<span class="food">Lunch</span> was over by half-past <span class="content">one</span>. By half-past two they were all ready for the <span class="act">fray</span>. The green-coated <span class="artifact">band</span> had arrived and was established in a <span class="solid">corner</span> of the tennis-court .``My <span class="physical_entity">dear</span>!"trilled Kitty Maitland,``aren't they too like <span class="artifact">frogs</span> for <span class="unit_of_measurement">words</span>? You ought to have arranged them <span class="content">round</span> the <span class="lake">pond</span> with the <span class="artifact">conductor</span> in the <span class="point">middle</span> on a <span class="section">leaf</span>."Laurie arrived and hailed them on his <span class="assets">way</span> to dress . At the <span class="attitude">sight</span> of him Laura remembered the <span class="happening">accident</span> again . She wanted to tell him . If Laurie agreed with the others, then it was bound to be all <span class="act">right</span>. And she followed him into the <span class="artifact">hall</span>.``Laurie!"`` Hallo!"He was half-way upstairs, but when he turned <span class="content">round</span> and saw Laura he suddenly puffed out his <span class="disrespect">cheeks</span> and goggled his <span class="artifact">eyes</span> at her .``My <span class="unit_of_measurement">word</span>, Laura! You do <span class="condition">look</span> stunning ,"said Laurie .``What an absolutely topping <span class="act">hat</span>!"Laura said faintly``Is it?"and smiled up at Laurie, and didn't tell him after all . Soon after that <span class="kin">people</span> began coming in <span class="motion">streams</span>. The <span class="artifact">band</span> struck up; the hired <span class="physical_entity">waiters</span> ran from the <span class="artifact">house</span> to the <span class="artifact">marquee</span>. Wherever you looked there were <span class="small_indefinite_quantity">couples</span> strolling, bending to the <span class="living_thing">flowers</span>, greeting, moving on over the <span class="region">lawn</span>. They were like bright <span class="artifact">birds</span> that had alighted in the Sheridans' <span class="region">garden</span> for this <span class="content">one</span> <span class="acknowledgment">afternoon</span>, on their <span class="assets">way</span> to---where? Ah, what <span class="feeling">happiness</span> it is to be with <span class="kin">people</span> who all are happy, to <span class="artifact">press</span> <span class="physical_entity">hands</span>, <span class="artifact">press</span> <span class="disrespect">cheeks</span>, <span class="gesture">smile</span> into <span class="artifact">eyes</span>.``<span class="physical_entity">Darling</span> Laura, how well you <span class="condition">look</span>!"`` What a becoming <span class="act">hat</span>, <span class="physical_entity">child</span>!"`` Laura, you <span class="condition">look</span> quite Spanish . I've never seen you <span class="condition">look</span> so striking ."And Laura, <span class="natural_phenomenon">glowing</span>, answered softly,``Have you had tea? Won't you have an <span class="agent">ice</span>? The passion-fruit <span class="agent">ices</span> really are rather special ."She ran to her <span class="physical_entity">father</span> and begged him .``Daddy <span class="physical_entity">darling</span>, can't the <span class="artifact">band</span> have something to drink?"And the perfect <span class="acknowledgment">afternoon</span> slowly ripened, slowly faded, slowly its <span class="natural_object">petals</span> closed .``Never a more delightful garden-party\...````The greatest success\ ..."`` Quite the most\...`` Laura helped her <span class="content">mother</span> with the <span class="acknowledgment">good-byes</span>. They stood <span class="food">side</span> by <span class="food">side</span> in the <span class="artifact">porch</span> <span class="substance">till</span> it was all over .``All over, all over, thank <span class="ability">heaven</span>,"said Mrs. Sheridan .``Round up the others, Laura . Let's go and have some fresh <span class="natural_object">coffee</span>. I'm exhausted . Yes, it's been very successful . But oh, these <span class="physical_entity">parties</span>, these <span class="physical_entity">parties</span>! Why will you <span class="physical_entity">children</span> insist on giving <span class="physical_entity">parties</span>!"And they all of them <span class="time_period">sat</span> down in the deserted <span class="artifact">marquee</span>.``Have a <span class="food">sandwich</span>, daddy <span class="physical_entity">dear</span>. I wrote the <span class="artifact">flag</span>."`` <span class="act">Thanks</span>."Mr. Sheridan took a <span class="condition">bite</span> and the <span class="food">sandwich</span> was gone . He took another .``I suppose you didn't hear of a beastly <span class="happening">accident</span> that happened to-day?"he said .``My <span class="physical_entity">dear</span>,"said Mrs. Sheridan, holding up her <span class="physical_entity">hand</span>,``we did . It nearly ruined the <span class="physical_entity">party</span>. Laura insisted we should put it off ."`` Oh, <span class="content">mother</span>!"Laura didn't want to be teased about it .``It was a horrible <span class="condition">affair</span> all the same ,"said Mr. Sheridan .``The <span class="solid">chap</span> was married too . Lived just below in the <span class="artifact">lane</span>, and <span class="section">leaves</span> a <span class="physical_entity">wife</span> and half a <span class="number">dozen</span> <span class="physical_entity">kiddies</span>, so they say ."An awkward little <span class="uncommunicativeness">silence</span> fell . Mrs. Sheridan fidgeted with her <span class="symbol">cup</span>. Really, it was very tactless of father\...Suddenly she looked up . There on the <span class="gathering">table</span> were all those <span class="food">sandwiches</span>, <span class="food">cakes</span>, <span class="bodily_process">puffs</span>, all uneaten, all going to be wasted . She had <span class="content">one</span> of her brilliant <span class="music">ideas</span>.``I know ,"she said .``Let's make up a <span class="act">basket</span>. Let's send that poor <span class="physical_entity">creature</span> some of this perfectly good <span class="solid">food</span>. At any <span class="ratio">rate</span>, it will be the greatest <span class="happening">treat</span> for the <span class="physical_entity">children</span>. Don't you agree? And she's sure to have <span class="object">neighbours</span> calling in and so on . What a <span class="component">point</span> to have it all ready prepared . Laura!"She jumped up .``Get me the big <span class="act">basket</span> out of the <span class="artifact">stairs</span> <span class="artifact">cupboard</span>."`` But, <span class="content">mother</span>, do you really think it's a good <span class="music">idea</span>?"said Laura . Again, how curious, she seemed to be different from them all . To take <span class="piece">scraps</span> from their <span class="physical_entity">party</span>. Would the poor <span class="class">woman</span> really like that?``Of <span class="line">course</span>! What's the <span class="cognitive_factor">matter</span> with you to-day? An <span class="time_period">hour</span> or two ago you were insisting on us being sympathetic, and now---"Oh well! Laura ran for the <span class="act">basket</span>. It was filled, it was heaped by her <span class="content">mother</span>.``Take it yourself, <span class="physical_entity">darling</span>,"said she .``Run down just as you are . No, <span class="act">wait</span>, take the <span class="living_thing">arum</span> <span class="living_thing">lilies</span> too . <span class="kin">People</span> of that <span class="act">class</span> are so impressed by <span class="living_thing">arum</span> <span class="living_thing">lilies</span>."`` The <span class="act">stems</span> will ruin her <span class="artifact">lace</span> <span class="artifact">frock</span>,"said practical Jose . So they would . Just in <span class="happening">time</span>.``Only the <span class="act">basket</span>, then . And, Laura!"-- -her <span class="content">mother</span> followed her out of the <span class="artifact">marquee</span>---"don't on any <span class="information">account</span>---"'' What <span class="content">mother</span>?"No, better not put such <span class="music">ideas</span> into the <span class="physical_entity">child</span>'s <span class="artifact">head</span>!``<span class="relative_quantity">Nothing</span>! Run along ."It was just growing dusky as Laura shut their <span class="region">garden</span> <span class="assets">gates</span>. A big <span class="artifact">dog</span> ran by like a <span class="physical_entity">shadow</span>. The <span class="act">road</span> gleamed white, and down below in the <span class="natural_depression">hollow</span> the little <span class="artifact">cottages</span> were in deep <span class="small_indefinite_quantity">shade</span>. How quiet it seemed after the <span class="acknowledgment">afternoon</span>. Here she was going down the <span class="natural_elevation">hill</span> to somewhere where a <span class="physical_entity">man</span> <span class="writing">lay</span> dead, and she couldn't realize it . Why couldn't she? She stopped a <span class="point">minute</span>. And it seemed to her that kisses, <span class="grammatical_relation">voices</span>, tinkling <span class="artifact">spoons</span>, <span class="act">laughter</span>, the <span class="condition">smell</span> of crushed <span class="physical_entity">grass</span> were somehow inside her . She had no <span class="gathering">room</span> for anything else . How strange! She looked up at the <span class="artifact">pale</span> <span class="gas">sky</span>, and all she thought was,``Yes, it was the most successful <span class="physical_entity">party</span>."Now the broad <span class="act">road</span> was crossed . The <span class="artifact">lane</span> began, smoky and <span class="time_period">dark</span>. <span class="class">Women</span> in <span class="artifact">shawls</span> and <span class="physical_entity">men</span>'s <span class="artifact">tweed</span> <span class="natural_object">caps</span> hurried by . <span class="physical_entity">Men</span> hung over the <span class="artifact">palings</span>; the <span class="physical_entity">children</span> played in the <span class="artifact">doorways</span>. A low <span class="happening">hum</span> came from the mean little <span class="artifact">cottages</span>. In some of them there was a <span class="happening">flicker</span> of <span class="appearance">light</span>, and a <span class="physical_entity">shadow</span>, crab-like, moved across the <span class="artifact">window</span>. Laura bent her <span class="artifact">head</span> and hurried on . She wished now she had put on a <span class="artifact">coat</span>. How her <span class="artifact">frock</span> shone! And the big <span class="act">hat</span> with the <span class="artifact">velvet</span> <span class="writing">streamer</span>---if only it was another <span class="act">hat</span>! Were the <span class="kin">people</span> looking at her? They must be . It was a <span class="act">mistake</span> to have come; she knew all along it was a <span class="act">mistake</span>. Should she go <span class="artifact">back</span> even now? No, too late . This was the <span class="artifact">house</span>. It must be . A <span class="time_period">dark</span> <span class="tactile_property">knot</span> of <span class="kin">people</span> stood outside . Beside the <span class="assets">gate</span> an old, old <span class="class">woman</span> with a <span class="artifact">crutch</span> <span class="time_period">sat</span> in a <span class="artifact">chair</span>, watching . She had her <span class="writing_style">feet</span> on a <span class="artifact">newspaper</span>. The <span class="grammatical_relation">voices</span> stopped as Laura drew near . The <span class="set">group</span> parted . It was as though she was expected, as though they had known she was coming here . Laura was terribly nervous . Tossing the <span class="artifact">velvet</span> <span class="artifact">ribbon</span> over her <span class="region">shoulder</span>, she said to a <span class="class">woman</span> <span class="information">standing</span> by,``Is this Mrs. Scott's <span class="artifact">house</span>?"and the <span class="class">woman</span>, smiling queerly, said,``It is, my <span class="physical_entity">lass</span>."Oh, to be away from this! She actually said,``Help me, God ,"as she walked up the tiny <span class="act">path</span> and knocked . To be away from those staring <span class="artifact">eyes</span>, or to be covered up in anything, <span class="content">one</span> of those <span class="class">women</span>'s <span class="artifact">shawls</span> even . I'll just leave the <span class="act">basket</span> and go, she decided . I shan't even <span class="act">wait</span> for it to be emptied . Then the <span class="artifact">door</span> opened . A little <span class="class">woman</span> in black showed in the <span class="feeling">gloom</span>. Laura said,``Are you Mrs . Scott?"But to her <span class="feeling">horror</span> the <span class="class">woman</span> answered,``Walk in please, <span class="language_unit">miss</span>,"and she was shut in the <span class="bodily_process">passage</span>.``No ,"said Laura,``I don't want to come in . I only want to leave this <span class="act">basket</span>. <span class="content">Mother</span> sent---"The little <span class="class">woman</span> in the gloomy <span class="bodily_process">passage</span> seemed not to have heard her .``Step this <span class="assets">way</span>, please, <span class="language_unit">miss</span>,"she said in an oily <span class="grammatical_relation">voice</span>, and Laura followed her . She found herself in a wretched little low <span class="artifact">kitchen</span>, lighted by a smoky <span class="artifact">lamp</span>. There was a <span class="class">woman</span> sitting before the <span class="happening">fire</span>.``<span class="unit_of_measurement">Em</span>,"said the little <span class="physical_entity">creature</span> who had let her in .``<span class="unit_of_measurement">Em</span>! It's a young <span class="physical_entity">lady</span>."She turned to Laura . She said meaningly,``I'm 'er <span class="physical_entity">sister</span>, <span class="language_unit">miss</span>. You'll <span class="artifact">excuse</span> 'er, won't you?"`` Oh, but of <span class="line">course</span>!"said Laura .``Please, please don't disturb her . I---I only want to leave---"But at that <span class="information">moment</span> the <span class="class">woman</span> at the <span class="happening">fire</span> turned <span class="content">round</span>. Her <span class="region">face</span>, puffed up, red, with swollen <span class="artifact">eyes</span> and swollen <span class="line">lips</span>, looked terrible . She seemed as though she couldn't understand why Laura was there . What did it mean? Why was this <span class="physical_entity">stranger</span> <span class="information">standing</span> in the <span class="artifact">kitchen</span> with a <span class="act">basket</span>? What was it all about? And the poor <span class="region">face</span> puckered up again .``All <span class="act">right</span>, my <span class="physical_entity">dear</span>,"said the other .``I'll thenk the young <span class="physical_entity">lady</span>."And again she began,``You'll <span class="artifact">excuse</span> her, <span class="language_unit">miss</span>, I'm sure ,"and her <span class="region">face</span>, swollen too, tried an oily <span class="gesture">smile</span>. Laura only wanted to get out, to get away . She was <span class="artifact">back</span> in the <span class="bodily_process">passage</span>. The <span class="artifact">door</span> opened . She walked straight through into the <span class="artifact">bedroom</span>, where the dead <span class="physical_entity">man</span> was lying .``You'd like a <span class="condition">look</span> at 'im, wouldn't you?"said <span class="unit_of_measurement">Em</span>'s <span class="physical_entity">sister</span>, and she brushed past Laura over to the <span class="region">bed</span>.``Don't be afraid, my <span class="physical_entity">lass</span>,"-- -and now her <span class="grammatical_relation">voice</span> sounded fond and sly, and fondly she drew down the <span class="artifact">sheet</span>---"' <span class="inhibitor">e</span> looks a <span class="statement">picture</span>. There's <span class="relative_quantity">nothing</span> to show . Come along, my <span class="physical_entity">dear</span>."Laura came . There <span class="writing">lay</span> a young <span class="physical_entity">man</span>, fast asleep---sleeping so soundly, so deeply, that he was far, far away from them both . Oh, so remote, so peaceful . He was dreaming . Never wake him up again . His <span class="artifact">head</span> was sunk in the <span class="artifact">pillow</span>, his <span class="artifact">eyes</span> were closed; they were blind under the closed <span class="body_part">eyelids</span>. He was given up to his <span class="ability">dream</span>. What did garden-parties and <span class="act">baskets</span> and <span class="artifact">lace</span> <span class="artifact">frocks</span> <span class="cognitive_factor">matter</span> to him? He was far from all those <span class="physical_entity">things</span>. He was wonderful, beautiful . While they were laughing and while the <span class="artifact">band</span> was playing, this <span class="happening">marvel</span> had come to the <span class="artifact">lane</span>. Happy\...happy\...All is well, said that sleeping <span class="region">face</span>. This is just as it should be . I am content . But all the same you had to cry, and she couldn't go out of the <span class="gathering">room</span> without saying something to him . Laura gave a loud childish <span class="information">sob</span>.``Forgive my <span class="act">hat</span>,"she said . And this <span class="happening">time</span> she didn't <span class="act">wait</span> for <span class="unit_of_measurement">Em</span>'s <span class="physical_entity">sister</span>. She found her <span class="assets">way</span> out of the <span class="artifact">door</span>, down the <span class="act">path</span>, past all those <span class="time_period">dark</span> <span class="kin">people</span>. At the <span class="solid">corner</span> of the <span class="artifact">lane</span> she met Laurie . He stepped out of the <span class="physical_entity">shadow</span>.``Is that you, Laura?"`` Yes ."`` <span class="content">Mother</span> was getting anxious . Was it all <span class="act">right</span>?"`` Yes, quite . Oh, Laurie!"She took his <span class="artifact">arm</span>, she pressed up against him .``I say, you're not crying, are you?"asked her <span class="physical_entity">brother</span>. Laura shook her <span class="artifact">head</span>. She was . Laurie put his <span class="artifact">arm</span> <span class="content">round</span> her <span class="region">shoulder</span>.``Don't cry ,"he said in his warm, loving <span class="grammatical_relation">voice</span>.``Was it awful?"`` No ,"sobbed Laura .``It was simply marvellous . But Laurie---"She stopped, she looked at her <span class="physical_entity">brother</span>.``Isn't <span class="time_period">life</span>,"she stammered ,"isn't <span class="time_period">life</span>---"But what <span class="time_period">life</span> was she couldn't explain . No <span class="cognitive_factor">matter</span>. He quite understood .``Isn't it, <span class="physical_entity">darling</span>?"said Laurie.</div><div id="controls"><ul><button onClick="show('artifact')">artifact</button><button onClick="show('physical_entity')">physical_entity</button><button onClick="show('act')">act</button><button onClick="show('content')">content</button><button onClick="show('living_thing')">living_thing</button><button onClick="show('happening')">happening</button><button onClick="show('time_period')">time_period</button><button onClick="show('food')">food</button><button onClick="show('condition')">condition</button><button onClick="show('grammatical_relation')">grammatical_relation</button><button onClick="show('class')">class</button><button onClick="show('acknowledgment')">acknowledgment</button><button onClick="show('region')">region</button><button onClick="show('information')">information</button><button onClick="show('natural_object')">natural_object</button></ul></div></main></body></html>
